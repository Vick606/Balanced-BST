# Balanced Binary Search Tree Implementation

## 🌳 Project Overview

This project implements a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript. It demonstrates key concepts of tree data structures, including insertion, deletion, traversal, and balancing operations.

## 🚀 Features

- Create a balanced BST from an array of numbers
- Insert and delete nodes while maintaining balance
- Perform various tree traversals:
  - Level Order
  - In-Order
  - Pre-Order
  - Post-Order
- Find nodes by value
- Calculate tree height and node depth
- Check tree balance
- Rebalance the tree when necessary
- Visualize the tree structure in the console

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Build the project
4. Run the driver script

## 📚 Code Structure

- `src/node.js`: Defines the Node class for BST nodes
- `src/tree.js`: Implements the Tree class with all BST operations
- `src/index.js`: Contains the driver script demonstrating BST functionality

## 🧪 Testing

The driver script in `index.js` provides a comprehensive demonstration of the BST's capabilities. It creates a tree, performs various operations, and displays the results.

## 🤔 Why Balanced BSTs?

Balanced BSTs ensure O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations. This efficiency makes them crucial in various applications, from database indexing to compiler symbol tables.
